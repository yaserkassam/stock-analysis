# Stock-Analysis

## **Overview of Project**
In this stock analysis we were asked to help out Steve helping his parents in help invest in green enrgy. With the data that we downloaded we are using **Visual Basics for Application** also known as **VBA** to automate tasks that are considered tedious and time consuming. In this project we were writing code to extract information from the data sheet of a particular year and create a table that is easy to read and shows us all the information we need to give the correct analysis. Also, We learned how to take out code that we have written and learn to tweak it so it runs more effecetively and efficently.

## **Results**
After using VBA and creating the Macro you can see the results from the data and which green stocks look promising. Steve's parents wanted to invest their money into the stock DQ. The stock preformed very well in 2017 showing a return of 199.4%. However, in 2018 it showed there was a major drop of 62.6%. Based on the information that we have from the green stocks the best investment would be ENPH; which has showed increase both in 2017 and 2018, 129.5% and 81.9% repectively.
Refactoring the code cut the the time it took the macro to run. With the original Macro that I had running 1.2 seconds and having to run another macro to get the formatting set. The Refactored Macro that I ran took under .3 seconds.
