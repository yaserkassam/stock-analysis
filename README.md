# Stock-Analysis

## **Overview of Project**
In this stock analysis we were asked to help out Steve helping his parents in help invest in green enrgy. With the data that we downloaded we are using **Visual Basics for Application** also known as **VBA** to automate tasks that are considered tedious and time consuming. In this project we were writing code to extract information from the data sheet of a particular year and create a table that is easy to read and shows us all the information we need to give the correct analysis. Also, We learned how to take out code that we have written and learn to tweak it so it runs more effecetively and efficently.
